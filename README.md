# "Neutron V" Syntax Theme for Atom (a violet modification of "Neutron")

Complementing syntax theme for the [Neutron UI](http://atom.io/packages/neutron-ui) package.

**Note:** this theme changes line-height, and there is currently a bug which incorrectly calculates line-height until you switch tabs. If your cursor is out of whack, just switch tabs.
